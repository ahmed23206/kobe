Born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Bryant is the youngest amongst the three children born to his father, Joe Bryant and mother, Pamela Cox Bryant. Bryant was named after a Japanese beef, Kobe, while his middle name Bean originates from his father’s nickname ‘jellybean’. When Bryant was at the age of six, his father retired from active play in the NBA and relocated to Italy where Bryant learnt Italian. During summer, Bryant returned to the USA to play basketball. His love for basketball may have been passed down from his father when he began playing at the young age of three.

Bryant became known nationally after an incredible high school performance at Lower Merion High School, he went on to play for Lower Merion Varsity team and became the first freshman to start for the Lower Merion Varsity team. Bryant earned Pennsylvania Player of the Year honour in his junior year, which brought him offers from various college recruiters. He also participated in the Adidas ABCD Camp where he received a senior MVP award in 1995. Bryant led the Lakers after a 53-years drought, to their first state championship while in the senior year.

He concluded his high school career on a remarkable note as Southeastern Pennsylvania’s all-time highest scorer with 2,883 points. He won several awards which include Men’s National Basketball Player of the Year, Naismith High School Player of the Year, and a McDonald’s All-American. Despite scoring 1080 in his SAT, Bryant decided to go pro after high school.
